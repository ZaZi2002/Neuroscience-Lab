## Visual Search Task

**Description:**
This assignment involves simulating a visual search experiment using Psychtoolbox. Participants search for high-value objects among low-value distractors in a series of trials.

**Key Components:**
- Implementation of the search phase, including fixation, object selection, and reward delivery.
- Random assignment of fractals and trial conditions.
- Recording and saving experimental data.
- Video recording of the experiment showing various trial situations.


## Regression and ANOVA Analysis

**Description:**
This assignment focuses on analyzing search time data using regression and ANOVA. It includes checking model assumptions, performing stepwise regression, and analyzing the impact of different variables.

**Key Components:**
- Loading and analyzing data with multiple linear regression.
- Checking assumptions with Q-Q plots, variance, and residual independence.
- Performing ANOVA with different models and post-hoc comparisons.
- Adding subject as a factor for additional ANOVA analysis.


## EEG Preprocessing and Analysis

**Description:**
This assignment involves preprocessing EEG data and analyzing ICA components and ERP results. The preprocessing steps include removing noise, re-referencing, and assessing the impact on ICA components.

**Key Components:**
- Preprocessing steps including noise removal, ICA, and re-referencing.
- Plotting and comparing ICA components before and after preprocessing.
- Extracting and analyzing ERP data for different stimulus conditions.


## fMRI Preprocessing and Analysis

**Description:**
This assignment covers preprocessing of fMRI data, including structural and functional image alignment, regressor construction, and GLM analysis.

**Key Components:**
- Skull removal and structural image processing.
- Functional image preprocessing and alignment with structural images.
- Construction of regressors for different experimental conditions.
- GLM analysis and correction for false positives.
